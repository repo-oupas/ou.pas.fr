# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Project Generated via
```
npx create-react-app ou.pas.fr --template typescript
```

## Analytics
I had two options :
  1. no visit tracking at all (best option)
  2. track at the condition I own the data, and ideally host the service at home, finally show visitor what is collected in a presentable fashion way.

### I do analytics but...
  Well I really want to see if this little page has success...
  For analytics I am using [matomo](https://matomo.org/),  
  No Google Analytics or whatsoever. Which seems to not resell the data gather in a localy hosted instance of MySQL.
  Hosted at : Hostinger 
  Since now a days it's all about tracking,  I want you to see what is collected... working on that

### My question for you
   - would you rather have me hosting the service (webserver and SQL DB ) "at home" or keep using it  ?
